# Testing Support Vector Machine Algorithm

In this project I have built an email classifier. This time instead of using NB classifier I have used SVM classifier.


## The Dataset

For this project I have used the same dataset as for the previous project.
The dataset is opensource free of charge.

[Previous project where I used NB classifier to build email classifier.](https://github.com/Manojlovic1998/email-classifier-mini-project)
## Expectation

Due to SVM downside I expect training for SVM classifier to be slower as the dataset increases in size. Nevertheless, this is just a testing prototype project.
